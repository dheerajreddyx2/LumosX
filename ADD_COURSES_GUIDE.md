```

---

## Customize the Sample Courses

Want to add your own courses instead? Edit `backend/seedCourses.js`:

```javascript
const sampleCourses = [
  {
    title: "Your Course Title",
    description: "Your course description here",
    duration: "X weeks"
  },
  // Add more courses...
];
```

Then run: `node seedCourses.js`

## Quick Commands Reference

### Add sample courses:
```bash
cd backend
node seedCourses.js
```

### Check total courses:

```bash
cd backend  
node -e "require('./models/Course'); require('mongoose').connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI).then(() => require('./models/Course').deleteMany({}).then(() => console.log('Cleared')))"
